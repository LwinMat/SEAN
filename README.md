# NEAR Application 

NEAR is a housing-technology application designed for users to post images and reports of incidents, cautions, or any occurrence in near by places and near their neighborhood.

The goal was to intend to generate online services that might help with society.

This application is a simple design where users can only see some basic components that can navigate to any other slides.

When initializing or opening the app, it will display a login/signup page. This applications is integrated with Firebase for Authentication and Authorization.

For the effort of this project, I was able to make this application with less execution where all the slides on Contacts slides or Group Slides are only samples.


To run this app do following.
* clone the repo
* navigate to the app folder name
* Type "npm install"
* Type "npx expo start"
